# Super Store Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
In this project as part of my tableau course, I have created an interactive sales dashboard using the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard aims to provide valuable insights into various aspects of sales performance. By utilizing the power of Tableau, I have designed a comprehensive report that visualizes category-wise sales, segment-wise sales, top 5 selling products, monthly trends of sales, year-over-year growth, total orders, customers, and average discounts.

## Interactive Features
One of the highlights of this dashboard is its interactivity. I have made all the graphs and charts interactive, allowing you to click on any graph to see the changes reflected on related sheets. This interactive feature enhances the user experience and enables you to explore the data from different perspectives.

Additionally, I have incorporated a "hide and show" filter option. This dropdown filter provides a convenient way to filter the data based on specific criteria, giving you more control over the information you want to focus on.

## Detailed Report
For those who seek more in-depth insights, I have included a "Detailed Report" button on the dashboard. When clicked, this button will take you to another dashboard that presents more comprehensive details about the sales performance. What makes it even more convenient is that the filter options applied on the previous dashboard will carry over to the detailed report dashboard, ensuring consistency and continuity in your analysis.
